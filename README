  the basic_testset is intended to be a template from which all EMAC testsets
  are built. as such, it contains a number of generic elements that must be
  adapted for each specific test. this is reflected most strongly in the
  'templates' directory, where a number of shell scripts and c files are kept.

  the reason these templates are kept in a separate directory rather than in the
  top-level for this project is that they are not intended to be modified and
  used directly since it is desirable to always be able to update the
  basic_testset part of a particular project without directly affecting the
  parts that have been modified for that project. to make this work, then, a
  number of tasks must be attended when initiating a specific testset project.
  those are:

    - move all the scripts and c-files you wish to use to the top-level of the
    testset's directory (that is to say, the directory that contains 
    templates, lib, include, et cetera)
    - rename all the files to reflect the specific test that they address. for
    example, the GE EVSC project dialog script might be called evsc_test.sh and
    its corresponding c-file called evsc_test.c
    - rename all the configuration files (those in the 'config' directory) to
    remove the trailing ".template". 

  an eventual goal of this project should be to automate the tedious task of
  synchronizing script and configuration file names for this project. in
  particular, there are several variables in the project.properties file that
  could be automatically updated by the same process that alters the names of
  the default/template files

  one additional piece of advice to follow when using this template/API is to
  run the following command to find recommended places in various files that
  should be modified on a per-project basis:

   $ grep -rn "TODO" *

  this will produce a list of file locations that the developers of this 
  testset though would be important to modify for a new specific testset
  instance
