== Python Serial Interfaces ==
This project is intended to provide higher-level constructs to existing standard
python interfaces, such as pyserial.

For example, suppose you want to automate communication with the U-Boot
bootloader over a serial connection, or perhaps with a remote Linux computer.

Another example would be communicating with devices over some weird ASCII serial
interface--such as Advantech's ADAM-4000 line of modules which accept ASCII
commands over RS-485, typically mediated by an otherwise silent
ADAM-4521/ADAM-4522 board. This is what I use it for.
